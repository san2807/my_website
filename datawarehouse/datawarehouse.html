    <b>Data Warehouse (DWH)</b><br>
    <br>
    * is a s/m used for reporting &amp; data analysis [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_warehouse">1</a>]<br>
    * considered a core component of BI [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_warehouse">1</a>]<br>
    * central repositories of integrated data from one or more disparate
    sources. [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_warehouse">1</a>]<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Data Integration (DI)<br>
    </b>* DI is the process of combining heterogeneous data sources into
    a single queriable schema so as to an unified view of these data. [<a href="https://dwbi.org/etl/etl/25-data-integration">1</a>]<br>
    <br>
    <b>why DI is required</b><br>
    * often large companies and enterprises maintain separate
    departmental d/bs to store the data pertaining to specific
    department. Although such seperations of the data provides them
    better manageability and security, performing any cross departmental
    analysis on these datasets becomes impossible.<br>

    <b>why do v need staging area during ETL load</b> [<a href="https://dwbi.org/etl/etl/52-why-do-we-need-staging-area-during-etl-load">1</a>]<br>
    "we have a simple DWH that takes data from few RDBMS sources systems
    and load the data in dimensions and facts tables of DWH. I wonder
    why we have a staging layer in between. Why can't we process
    everything on the fly and push then in DWH".<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; staging area is not a necessity if we can handle
    it on the fly. Few reasons why v can't avoid a staging area:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * source systems r only
    available for extraction during a specific time slot which is
    generally lesser than your overall data loading time.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Its good
    idea to extract and keep things at your end before you lose the
    connection to the source s/ys<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * u want to extract data based
    on some conditions which require u to join two or more different
    s/ys together.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * various source s/ys hav
    different allotted timings for data exaction.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * DWH data loading frequency
    does not match with the refresh frequencies of the source s/ys.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * ETL process involves complex
    data t/ns that require extra space to temporarily stage the data<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * There is specific data
    reconciliation / debugging requirement which warrants the use of
    staging area for pre, during or post load data validations<br>

    </b>1. ETL solution takes more time to design than analytical
    solutions<br>
    2. DWH scope will increase along the development<br>
    3. Issues will be discovered in the source system that went
    undetected till date<br>
    4. u will need to validate data not being validated in source s/ms<br>
    5. user training will not be sufficient and user will not put their
    training in use<br>
    6. users will create conflicting business rules<br>
    7. volumetric mis-judgement is more common than you thought<br>
    8. It is ultimately IT's responsibility to prove the correctness of
    data<br>
    9. DWH project incur high maintenance cost <br>
    10. amount of time needed to refresh ur DWH is going to be your top
    concern<br>

      Methods of Incremental Loading in Data Warehouse </b>[<a href="https://dwbi.org/etl/etl/53-methods-of-incremental-loading-in-data-warehouse">1</a>]<b><br>
    </b>* incremental loading a.k.a <font color="#ff6600"><b>delta
        loading</b></font> is an widely used method to load data in DWH
    from respective source s/ms<br>
    * in almost all the data ware housing scenarios, we extract data
    from one or more source s/ms and keep storing them in DWH for future
    analysis.<br>
    * the source s/ms are generally OLTP s/ms which store everyday
    transactional data <br>
    * when it comes to loading these transactional data to dwh, v hav 2
    approaches:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Full Load<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Incremental Load<br>
    <br>
    <b>Incremental Loading for Dimension Table</b> [<a href="https://dwbi.org/etl/etl/54-incremental-loading-for-dimension-table.html">1</a>]<br>
    Should we do incremental loading for dimensions?<br>
    In a dimensional model, we may perform incremental loading for
    dimension tables also. One may argue that this wont be necessary as
    data volume in dimension tables are not as high as the data volumes
    in the fact tables, hence we can simply do a full load every time.<br>
    <br>
    I personally do not agree to this argument. This is because during
    the last few years I have seen tremendous growth in the data in
    dimension tables and things can get quite heavy especially if we are
    trying to load SCD type 2 dimensions. Anyway, without much ado,
    let's delve deep.<br>
    <br>
    Standard Method of Loading<br>
    Like before, for our purpose we will assume we have the below
    customer table in our source system from where we need to perform
    the data loading.<br>
    <br>
    CustomerID&nbsp; CustomerName&nbsp;
    Type&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LastUpdatedDate<br>

    <b><a name="tight"></a>Tight Coupling</b> [<a href="https://dwbi.org/etl/etl/25-data-integration">1</a>]<br>
    * in case of tight coupling approach - which is often implemented
    through data warehousing, data is pulled over from disparate sources
    into a single physical location through ETL process.<br>
    * this approach is called tight coupling as data is tightly coupled
    with the physical repository at the time of query.<br>
