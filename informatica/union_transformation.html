    <b>Union Transformation</b><br>
    <br>
    * multiple input group transformation use to merge data from
    multiple pipelines or pipeline branches into one pipeline branch.<br>
    * merges the data from multiple sources similar to UNION ALL SQL
    statement to combine results from two or more SQL statements.<br>
    * Similar to UNION ALL statement, UNION transformation <font color="#ff0000">does not remove</font> duplicate rows. to remove
    duplicate rows u must add another transformation like ROUTER or
    FILTER.<br>
    * int service processes all input groups in parallel.<br>
    * it concurrently read sources connected to UNION transformation and
    pushes blocks of data into input groups of transformation.<br>
    * it processes blocks of data based on order it receives blocks from
    int services.<br>
    * developed using <font color="#ff0000">CUSTOM </font>transformation
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Rules</b><br>
    * can create multiple input groups but only one output group.<br>
    * all input groups and output group must have matching ports.
    precision, datatype and scale must be identical across all groups.<br>
    * cannot use a SEQUENCE generator or UPDATE STRATEGY upstream from a
    union transformation.<br>
    * union transformation doesn't generate transactions.<br>
