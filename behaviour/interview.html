<br>
<br>
used running total, moving averages for credit card fraud cases <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
challenges for SSIS<br>
in my last project, for one of the job we were having to completed it a atime frame of 45 min.<br>
we tuned that job by below solution<br>
* SCD transformation was taking a lot of time. we changed it and used Lookup t/f and Merge t/f <br>
<br>
it was taking time coz at the time it was designed the table was small 
but over the period of time table grown so much that its hindering the<br>
overall performance of the package. One thing we observed table was used
 which by default extract select * for the table and was getting all 
columns</body></html>
